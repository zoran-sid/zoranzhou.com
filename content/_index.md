- 🎯 **Profession**

  Between 2023 and 2025, I took on a challenge and secured the Cisco Certified Specialist (Enterprise Infrastructure) certification. For me, it's not just a certificate, it proves my robust ability to build and maintain large-scale network architectures. I through obtain the CISP-PTE (Penetration Testing Engineer) certification, and gaining hands-on network experience have broadened my perspective on traditional networking.

- 🛠️ **Practices**

  I have experience on Offense & Defense (PEN Testing), Emergency Respons (Coordination), Ops & Architecture (Networking). My expertise comes from "combat" experience with leading domestic security firms and national infrastructure units. I served on the emergency team for many times about national cybersecurity defense operation. I believe that the true practices are good ways to improve the foundational ability.

  Continuous learning and challenging myself—that’s the heart of this blog.
