# Resume

I am ZHOU CHEN, and this website serves as my personal blog where I recording my life and studies. I majored in computer science at XINHUA University starting in 2020, and I am currently a self-employed cybersecurity engineer.

In 2025, I took a gap year to focus on studying Cisco Enterprise infrastructure and achieved the prestigious CCIE certification. Afterward, I spent some time in the Philippines improving my English skills.

I think life as a competition that demands careful attention to challenges at every turn, which can lead to pressure and setbacks. However, I remain passionate about life and learning, always striving to move forward.
